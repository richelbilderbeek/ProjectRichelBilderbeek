/// to generate the Delaunay triangulation of these two polygons.
///
/// You might think of this routine's behavior as a two-step process.  The
/// first step is to walk from endpoint1 to endpoint2, flipping each edge
/// encountered.  This step creates a fan of edges connected to endpoint1,
/// including the desired edge to endpoint2.  The second step enforces the

/// as if it had just been inserted, but affecting only the previous
/// vertices.  The result is the same as if the vertices had been inserted
/// in the order they appear on the polygon, so the result is Delaunay.
///
/// In truth, constrainededge() interleaves these two steps.  The procedure
/// walks from endpoint1 to endpoint2, and each time an edge is encountered
/// and flipped, the newly exposed vertex (at the far end of the flipped
/// edge) is "enforced" upon the previously flipped edges, usually affecting
/// only one side of the polygon (depending upon which side of the segment
/// the vertex falls on).
///
/// The algorithm is complicated by the need to handle polygons that are not
/// convex.  Although the polygon is not necessarily monotone, it can be
/// triangulated in a manner similar to the stack-based algorithms for
/// monotone polygons.  For each reflex vertex (local concavity) of the
/// polygon, there will be an inverted triangle formed by one of the edge
/// flips.  (An inverted triangle is one with negative area - that is, its
/// vertices are arranged in clockwise order - and is best thought of as a

/// later.
///
/// A reflex vertex is popped from the stack when a vertex is inserted that

/// the destination; note that this is not the same edge that is a side of
/// the polygon.  `firstedge' is the primary edge of the first triangle.
/// From there, the triangles follow in counterclockwise order about the
/// polygon, until `lastedge', the primary edge of the last triangle.
/// `firstedge' and `lastedge' are probably connected to other triangles
/// beyond the extremes of the fan, but their identity is not important, as
/// long as the fan remains connected to them.
///
/// Imagine the polygon oriented so that its base is at the bottom.  This
/// puts `firstedge' on the far right, and `lastedge' on the far left.
/// The right vertex of the base is the destination of `firstedge', and the
/// left vertex of the base is the apex of `lastedge'.
///
/// The challenge now is to find the right sequence of edge flips to
/// transform the fan into a Delaunay triangulation of the polygon.  Each
/// edge flip effectively removes one triangle from the fan, committing it
/// to the polygon.  The resulting polygon has one fewer edge.  If `doflip'
/// is set, the final flip will be performed, resulting in a fan of one
/// (useless?) triangle.  If `doflip' is not set, the final flip is not
/// performed, resulting in a fan of two triangles, and an unfinished

/// Although the flips are performed in the order described above, the

/// unflip()   Transform two triangles to two different triangles by
///            flipping an edge clockwise within a quadrilateral.  Reverses
///            the flip() operation so that the data structures representing
///            the triangles are back where they were before the flip().
///
/// Imagine the original triangles, abc and bad, oriented so that the
/// shared edge ab lies in a horizontal plane, with the vertex b on the left
/// and the vertex a on the right.  The vertex c lies below the edge, and
/// the vertex d lies above the edge.  The `flipedge' handle holds the edge
/// ab of triangle abc, and is directed left, from vertex a to vertex b.
///
/// The triangles abc and bad are deleted and replaced by the triangles cdb
/// and dca.  The triangles that represent abc and bad are NOT deallocated;
/// they are reused for cdb and dca, respectively.  Hence, any handles that
/// may have held the original triangles are still valid, although not
/// directed as they were before.
///
/// Upon completion of this routine, the `flipedge' handle holds the edge
/// cd of triangle cdb, and is directed up, from vertex c to vertex d.
/// (Hence, the two triangles have rotated clockwise.)
///
/// WARNING:  This transformation is geometrically valid only if the
/// quadrilateral adbc is convex.  Furthermore, this transformation is
/// valid only if there is not a subsegment between the triangles abc and
/// bad.  This routine does not check either of these preconditions, and
/// it is the responsibility of the calling routine to ensure that they are
/// met.  If they are not, the streets shall be filled with wailing and
/// gnashing of teeth.
