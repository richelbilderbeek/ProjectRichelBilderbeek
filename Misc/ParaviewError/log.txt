From command prompt:

paraView

In paraView
- From the menu bar, select 'Source | Cylinder' to create a cylinder
- In the bar on the left, click Apply to view the cylinder. 
- View screenshot 'before.png'. I did rotate the cylinder a bit and chose 'Surface With Edges'
- File | Save data, save file as cylinder.stl, choose File type 'Ascii'
- close paraView

From command prompt:

  paraView cylinder.stl

In paraView:
- In the bar on the left, click Apply to view the cylinder
- View screenshot 'after.png'. I did rotate the cylinder a bit and chose 'Surface With Edges'

When saving as ASCII, the object becomes messed up

When doing the same steps with a cone, saving to binary, the same error happens

When doing the same steps with a box, saving to ascii, the same error happens

When doing the same steps with a sphere, saving to binary, everything is fine
