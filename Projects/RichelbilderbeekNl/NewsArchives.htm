Check out the 'Tools' section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a> to see 'BarbaImage'.</li>
  <li>23-10-2007: Finished the great tool called 'Hometrainer'. It helps one to practice nouns, verbs and/or definitions. It saves me a lot of time not having to create trainers for everything I want to train myself. Check out the 'Tools' section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>. Licenced under GPL 3.0. Who said one cannot become a <i>Homo Universalis</i> anymore?</li>
  <li>22-10-2007: Yesterday, I've improved the code of 'Maziak' (<a href="Games.htm">Go to the Games page to see 'Maziak'</a>), so one can choose a 999x999 sized maze. So I've also updated the 'Maze' section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>. By the way, finishing a 999x999 sized maze, with the path to the exit known, took me about ten minutes in 'Maziak'. Still, I don't know if I was lucky...</li>
  <li>20-10-2007: Let's see if I can get myself doing something else then programming after having finished my new game 'Maziak'. A clone of the MSX classic! I love it, so I put it online. <a href="Games.htm">Go to the Games page to see 'Maziak'</a>. Licenced under GPL 3.0, so you can also view my beautifull source code.</li>
  <li>19-10-2007: Having even more time left on this free day, I've put some more tools on my page: 'Color Number Determinator' to see a color from an RGB value and 'Random Code', a tool to generate random C++ code. So check out the 'Tools' section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>! And if in doubt, check the screenshots. All my tools are licenced under GPL 3.0.</li>
  <li>19-10-2007: Damn holiday! Today, I've finally put my maze generation algorithm on this site, as well as a tool to check the algorithm visually. The algorithm 'CreateMaze' can be found under the 'Mathematics' section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>. The tool 'MazeCreator' (nifty naming, eh?) can be found under the 'Tools' section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>. The tool is licenced under GPL 3.0.</li>
  <li>18-10-2007: Ported one of my own favorite QBASIC games to C++. Seven years ago, I called the game Boenken, and the C++ port still brings honour to this name ('Boenken' in English would yield 'Bonking'). Also, the game can support a maximum of twenty players! Prepare for cosy evenings behind your keyboard with your friends. Like all my games, it is licenced under GPL 3.0. <a href="Games.htm">Go to the Games page to see 'Boenken'</a>.</li>
  <li>17-10-2007: Added a VCL version of 'Image Rotater', a tool to rotate images under any angle. See the 'Tools' section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>.</li>
  <li>16-10-2007: Yesterday, I've discovered a very simple cryptography algorithm! See the Mathematics section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>. And to test and use it, I wrote a suite of programs under the nominator 'Encrypter'. See the Tools section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>. As always, the tool is licenced under GPL 3.0.</li>
  <li>15-10-2007: Simplified the use of the music section. See <a href="Music.htm">Music</a>.</li>
  <li>13-10-2007: Added a simple new code snippet called 'Trim' to remove leading and trailing spaces, at the std::string section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>.</li>
  <li>12-10-2007: Programmed a new tool called 'Morpher'. It generates intermediate images and writes these to disc automatically. Licenced under GPL 3.0. Check the Tools section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>.</li>
  <li>05-10-2007: Wrote a new RichelCult poem called 'Som Zeven'. See <a href="RichelCult.htm">RichelCult</a></li>
  <li>29-09-2007: Wrote and recorded a new hit 'Organellenwals' for the fans and one of my Belcampo school classes! See <a href="Music.htm">Music</a>.</li>
  <li>29-09-2007: Changed my E-mail adress.<a href="Email.png">You can view my E-mail adress here</a>. Try sending your fanmail there!</li>
  <li>24-09-2007: In the morning one can put great games made by others online, in the evening one might create his own great games and put them online. Today, I've finally programmed the game Reversi in C++, licenced under GPL 3.0. That's about nine years after I've programmed it in QBasic. Check the <a href="Games.htm">Games</a> section.</li>
  <li>24-09-2007: Today I've had the great honor to put a great game by Joost van den Bogaart online: 'Wizard Battle', licenced under GPL 3.0. See <a href="Games.htm">Games</a>.</li>
  <li>22-09-2007: Knokfighter 1! A great game! Today, I put the source code, Windows executable and resources of 'Knokfighter 1' online, licenced under GPL 3.0. Also the future Knokfighter storyline can be viewed. See <a href="Games.htm">Games</a>.</li>
  <li>19-09-2007: Put the presentation of 'Eukaryote' on my <a href="Projects.htm">Projects</a> page.</li>
  <li>07-09-2007: Added a paper-rock-scissors simulation program, licenced under GPL 3.0. See the  'Biology' section of <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>.</li>
  <li>12-08-2007: All games are supplied with source code and licenced under GPL 3.0. See <a href="Games.htm">Games</a>.</li>
  <li>11-08-2007: I have the honour to add the game 'Public Toilet Manager 5' on my website. The game is developed by Joost van den Bogaart under the GPL 3.0 licence, so the source code can be downloaded as well. See <a href="Games.htm">Games</a>.</li>
  <li>10-08-2007: When one can rotate images, one makes a tool called 'The Image Rotater' (spelling error intended). See <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>.</li>
  <li>07-08-2007: YAHOO! After 17 years of struggling, I've finally been able to create a C++ function to rotate a bitmap under any angle! See <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>.</li>
  <li>29-07-2007: I've seen that when copy-pasting my code, extra empty lines are added. I've tried to write a tool ('The Empty Lines Remover', see <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">Code Snippets C++</a>), but it did not work. Adding links to a plain text file does work fine.</li>
  <li>27-07-2007: Added Bjarne Stroustrup, Herb Sutter, Andrei Alexandrescu, Scott Meyers, Andrew Koenig en the young Bill Gates to the C++ panel of the C++ course.

  <li>21-07-2007: Added my course 'Programmeren in C++ voor beginners' to my website. See <a href="Courses.htm">Courses</a>.</li>
  <li>18-07-2007: The pictures of me performing could not be found. Nobody missed them, nevertheless I've fixed it. Ignore <a href="Performances.htm">Performances</a> like usual.</li>
  <li>17-07-2007: The course guide ('cursusgids') with my C++ course at the <a href="http://www.stadswerkplaats.nl/">Stadswerkplaats Groningen</a> has gone to press. See the site of the <a href="http://www.stadswerkplaats.nl/">Stadswerkplaats Groningen</a>.</li>
  <li>17-07-2007: I did not like having a 'Code' page and a 'Code Snippets' page, so I combined the two. See the new <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">C++ Code Snippets</a> and the <a href="TexasCodeSnippets.htm">Texas TI-84 Plus Code Snippets</a> page.</li>
  <li>16-07-2007: I did not like the licence of <a href="http://www.codepedia.com">CodePedia</a>, so I decided to put my C++ knowledge online for <b><i>everyone</i></b> to use. See <a href="CppCodeSnippets.htm">C++ Code Snippets</a>.</li>
