<p>This teaching work form has nothing to do with the TV-program 'Brainiac'!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The Brainiac teaching work form can be used to prepare students</p>
<p> for a test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The Brainiac teaching form proceeds as follows:</p>
<p> 1) Let all students sit side-by-side facing the teacher.</p>
<p>       Every student must have a text book</p>
<p>       The person at the most right is the Brainiac,</p>
<p>       the person at the most left is lowest in rank.</p>
<p> 2) All students need to make up questions from the theory</p>
<p> 3) If a student has found a question, he/she touches the</p>
<p>      shoulder of a student higher in rank. The question is posed.</p>
<p>      If the question is not correctly answered, the answer is given</p>
<p>      and the students switch places, else they remain seated. If</p>
<p>      the students disagree about the question being answered right</p>
<p>      or wrong, they also remain seated.</p> 
<p> 4) A student is only allowed to ask questions as long as not being</p>
<p>      asked a question (from the student lower in rank).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I also program a simulation of the Brainiac teaching form, called 'SimBrainiac'. <a href="ToolSimBrainiac.htm">Go to the SimBrainiac page</a>.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> At the 28th of March of 2008, I used the Brainiac teaching form</p>
<p> in one of my VMBO third-year classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I measured the level of fun and the level of learning by counting fingers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3> Level of fun</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> * Very boring     : 1</p>
<p> * Boring            : 0</p>
<p> * Neutral           : 2</p>
<p> * Fun               : 3</p> 
<p> * Very much fun : 6</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3> Level of learning</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> * Having learned nothing at all: 0</p>
<p> * Having learning not that much: 1</p>
<p> * Learned as much as a lecture : 6</p>
<p> * Learned more then usual        : 5</p>
<p> * Learned much more then usual : 0</p>
