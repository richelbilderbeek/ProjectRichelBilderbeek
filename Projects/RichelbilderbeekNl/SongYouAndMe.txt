You And Me

My life 
changed tremendously 
when you came to see 
the Loveboys and (especially) me 

You threw 
your knickers to me 
so that I would see 
you want to be with me 

Due to that gift 
I've fallen in love 
just wanting to see 
you lying next to me 

And that night 
this dream became true 
made love all night 
then breakfast for you 

When I said 
your breasts are to small 
you started to cry 
I didn't knew why 

So I said 
I'll pay the operation 
so I can see 
your breasts more easily 

So we
talked near-infinitely
until you and me
could the solution see

You agreed 
to get bigger breasts
so that I could see
your breasts more easily

And also I
had to get an eye-operation
so that I could see
more easily

And that week
we both had surgery
and I couldn't wait
your bigger breasts to see

But when my eyes
we fixed finally
your breasts weren't just big
but gigantically enormously

This
then caused for me
that I couldn't be
with you foreverly

For you
this was painfully
you got depressed
because you missed me

Then you
committed suicide
because you couldn't be
without me

And now
I see very clearly
that I should have
behaved differently

Since then
I changed heavily
it's the inside that counts
you made me this see very clearly

So I hope
you and your big breasts live happily
because in heaven
there is no gravity
