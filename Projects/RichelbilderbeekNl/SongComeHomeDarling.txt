Come home darling 
I will hold you 
Come home darling 
I will kiss you 
 
You're the one 
I've always searched for 
I will love you 
night and day 
 
I don't believe in God 
but I'm in love with you 
so if he exists 
I hope he's watching you. 
'cause you are far away 
far over the sea 
but in all my dreams 
you are still 
with me 
 
Come home darling 
I will hold you 
Come home darling 
I will kiss you
