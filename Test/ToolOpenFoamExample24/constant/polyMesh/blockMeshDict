//A cube with the following vertex indices:
//
//    6-----7
//   /|\   /|
//  / | \ / |
// 4-----5  |
// |  |  |  |
// |  2--|--3
// | / \ | /
// |/   \|/
// 0-----1
//
//Each vertex is of the form (x y z)
//
//The local coordinate system is defined by the order in which the vertices are presented in the block definition according to:
//- the axis origin is the first entry in the block definition, vertex 0 in our example;
//- the x direction is described by moving from vertex 0 to vertex 1;
//- the y direction is described by moving from vertex 0 to vertex 2;
//- vertices 0, 1, 2, 3 define the plane z
//- vertex 4 is found by moving from vertex 0 in the z direction;
//- vertices 5,6 and 7 are similarly found by moving in the z direction from vertices 1,2 and 3
