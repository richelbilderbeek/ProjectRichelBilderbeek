2010-09-15
	Fixed rational.h to include <limits>

2010-08
	Added pattern matching for Equation
	Added elementary solve routines

2009-10-27
	Corrected the handling of powers of products in Product::subst,
	i.e. when expanding (a*b)^2 a and b must be inserted directly into
	the list of factors.

2009-10-20
	Corrected a bug in comparing non-commutative products.

2009-10-19
	Pattern matching for non-commutative products added.
	Added solve.h and integration.h.
	Initial support for equation solving: linear, quadratic, cubic.
	Initial support for integration using a few apptern matches.

2009-10-15
	Completed pattern matching (commutative products only).
	Added substitution with pattern matching (BindingEquation).

2009-10-02:
	Added a^(b+c) = a^b*a^c in Product::expand. This helps
 	to simplify some expressions.
	Fix Derivative::subst to check whether the function changed
	and if not avoid re-computing the derivatives. This fixes
	a problem when differentiating f[x, y[x]] in some cases.
	Fix Product::subst to ignore substitutions of constants, which always
	work.

2009-05-22:
	Some parts were incorrectly marked as part of the library
	or part of the headers for the GNU autoconf version.

2009-05-20:
	Changed Cloning and CloningPtr classes to simplify
	and hopefully improve readability.

2009-04-14:
	Made the vacuum state and its dual non-commutative in
	examples/fermi.cpp and added some simplifying rules.

2009-03-31:
	Fixed the symbolic cross product.

2009-01-20:
	Provide GNU configure build and install
	Added headers/symbolicc++.h
		for use instead of headers/symbolic/symbolicc++.h
