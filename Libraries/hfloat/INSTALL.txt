You have to install the FXT library before
compiling hfloat, see http://www.jjj.de/fxt/

Now do a
  make install
That's it.


By default, things are installed under
/usr/local/lib/  (library)
/usr/local/include/hfloat/  (header files)

The install directory can be changed as follows:
  make install PREFIX=/some/dir/
will install things under
/some/dir/lib/  (library)
/some/dir/include/hfloat/  (header files)

Note the the directories
/some/dir/
/some/dir/include/
have to exists before the installation.

You need the permissions to write in the directories
/some/dir/
/some/dir/include/
In doubt, do the installation as root.



An example program ./pi can be created via
  make pi
Type
  ./pi -h
to find out what the program can do.

The directory examples/ contains additional simple
programs that demonstrate how to use the library.
Type
  make exmaples
to compile all exmaple programs.
These are named
 ./ex0
 ./ex1
 ./ex2
 (etc.)
