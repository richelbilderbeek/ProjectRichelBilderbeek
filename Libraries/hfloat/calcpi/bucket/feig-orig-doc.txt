    in feig.h  
    you find the superattractive periodic points on the
    negative real axis of the mandelbrot set sa[.].

    together with half[.] and deriv[.] and knowledge of
    of the feigenbaum stuff you can calculate 
    (using repeatedly aitken delta squared method)
    delta (4.6692...) to 29 , alpha (2.5029...) to 28 
    and the critical point (1.4011...) to 45 decimal places.
  
    this was a cpu-week for the 486/66.
  
    i used a method based on that described in 'chaos and fractals'
    by peitgen, juergens and saupe (springer).
  
    in his 1991 paper  (math of comp, 57, 195)
    'a precise calculation of the feigenbaum constants '
    keith briggs gives 102 digits of alpha and 85 places of delta.
    he solved the functional equation given bei feigenbaum in
    his papers.
  
    i found the paper _after_ doing the calculations :-((  ...
